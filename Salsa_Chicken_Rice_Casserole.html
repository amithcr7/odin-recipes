		<h2>Description</h2>

		<h3>Ingredients</h3>
		
		<ul>
			<li>1 ⅓ cups uncooked white rice</li>
			<li>2 ⅔ cups water</li>
			<li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>
			<li>2 cups shredded Monterey Jack cheese</li>
			<li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
			<li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of chicken soup</li>
			<li>1 (10.75 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
			<li>1 onion, chopped</li>
			<li>1 ½ cups mild salsa</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Directions</h4>
		<p> Step 1
		Place rice and water in a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer for 20 minutes.</p>

		<p>Step 2
		Meanwhile, place chicken breast halves into a large saucepan, and fill the pan with water. Bring to a boil, and cook for 20 minutes, or until done. Remove chicken from water. When cool enough to handle, cut meat into bite-size pieces.</p>

		<p>Step 3
		Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish.</p>

		<p>Step 4
		In a medium bowl, combine Monterey Jack and Cheddar cheeses. In a separate bowl, mix together cream of chicken soup, cream of mushroom soup, onion, and salsa. Layer 1/2 of the rice, 1/2 of the chicken, 1/2 of the soup and salsa mixture, and 1/2 of the cheese mixture in prepared dish. Repeat layers, ending with cheese.</p>

		<p>Step 5
		Bake in preheated oven for about 40 minutes, or until bubbly.</p>
